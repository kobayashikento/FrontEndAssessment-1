Front-End Assessment where I am tasked to turn the design into a website. Most of the animations will be done using React-Spring. Home page transition (wave motion) will be done using curtains.js. Routing will be done using React-Router-Dom. Might use Material UI for existing buttons to save time.

MAIN LIBRARIES: React, React-Router-Dom, React-Spring, curtains.js, possibly but unlikely Material UI for buttons etc...

Note: Most of the time will probably be used on learning curtains.js, a quick read suggests that the animation is done through WebGL and canvas.

Plan:

1) Code the main page using curtains.js, the transitions and buttons can be easily done using React and React-Spring EST. 8 hours

2) Code the burger menu according to the specifications. EST. 1 hour

3) Scatch off for yellow page can be coded easily using canvas and existing code in my library EST. 1 hour

4) Sections 2,3,4,5 should be will take 1 hour each to complete. EST 4 hours

5) Code the audio experience last if time permits. 6*) Probably make a button on the main page (homepage) to toggle between different transition styles (1. water/wave motions, 2. circle motion) for testings purposes to see which transition fits.

A couple of things I can add, curtainjs is not limited to images, what if there was a moving video in the main menu. (implement this when time persists)
