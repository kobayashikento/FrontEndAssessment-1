# FrontEndAssessment-1
Front-End Assessment where I am tasked to turn the design into a website. Most of the animations will be done using React-Spring. 
Home page transition (wave motion) will be done using curtains.js. Routing will be done using React-Router-Dom. Might use Material UI for existing buttons to save time.

Note: Most of the time will probably be used on learning curtains.js, a quick read suggests that the animation is done through WebGL and canvas. 

Plan: 
1) Code the main page using curtains.js, the transitions and buttons can be easily done using React and React-Spring 
    EST. 8 hours
2) Code the burger menu according to the specifications.
